# Python Learning Projects
<h2>Some of the projects I made as a student using python</h2>
<b>projectilemotionprogram.py</b> - Gets the initial velocity, angle to the horizontal, and the gravitational acceleration (g) of an object from the user. Prints the horizontal distance and maximum height reached by the object. 
<b>quadratic_root_calculator.py</b> - Gets constants A, B and C as for a quadratic equation of the form Ax^2 + Bx + C, and returns the root or roots for it(as an integer or a tuple).
