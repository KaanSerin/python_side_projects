# Python Learning Projects
<h2>Some of the projects I made as a student using python</h2>
<b>projectilemotionprogram.py</b> - Gets the initial velocity, angle to the horizontal, and the gravitational acceleration (g) of an object from the user. Prints the horizontal distance and maximum height reached by the object. 

<b>quadratic_root_calculator.py</b> - Gets constants A, B and C as for a quadratic equation of the form Ax^2 + Bx + C, and returns the root or roots for it(as an integer or a tuple).

<b>rock_paper_scissors_game.py</b> - Gets user input and maps it to:
<lu>
  <li> 1: Rock </li>
  <li> 2: Paper </li>
  <li> 3: Scissors </li>
</lu>
The computer picks at random. Until the user enters -1, the game continues. When -1 is entered, the winner and each players respective scores are printed.
